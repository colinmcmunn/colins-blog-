### _Summary_
---

_Georgia Journeys: Legacies of World War II_, is a digital humanities project created by Adina Langer, a professor at Kennesaw State University. The project took me through an in depth story, talking about World War II veterans, front line workers, and Holocaust survivors. Everyone that is included in the project has some link to the state of Georgia, which is where the museum of History and Holocaust Education is located, at Kennesaw State University. The purpose of this blog is to dissect the Georgia Journeys digital humanities project, pointing out both positive and negative experiences that I faced while using it. 


### _Findings_ 
---

Overall, this project is very understandable and simple to use. The two main pieces that are to be taken away from this project are the shared stories from each individual person, and the journeys they took throughout their life. These two things are incredibly easy to access, and it is seen at the top of the main page. There are two tabs labeled **“Stories”** and **“Journeys”**, and by clicking on either one guided me to what I was looking for. Below is an image showing the two tabs.

Some more positives from this project is that there is a visible search bar and a menu tab. On the menu tab it gave me the option to explore. This is a very interesting piece, because instead of “exploring” the project, it lead me to a page that tells stories of life before and after WWII. This is a nice way to add in the extra pieces of information, without making the cover page too bulky. 

While there are a lot of positives that can be taken away from this project, there are also many ways it can be improved. One example is that on the main map, when I clicked on the icons to view a story, the project does not show what icons I clicked on. This is a problem since there are so many icons, it was easy for me to lose track of what I have already clicked on, and reclick the ones I have already seen. One way that this can be fixed is through color coordination. For example, if the unopened icons are all red, and the opened icons are green, there should be no confusion.  

Another area for improvement for this project is that when I click on the journeys tab, it brings me to a list of names. The names that are displayed are the storytellers in this project. When I click on the individual names, it brings me to a map showing that certain person's life journey. Being displayed on the map, there are supposed to be icons that are to be clicked on to view the story being told; however, on **Lorenzo Wallaces** name, there are no icons. I know that there are supposed to be icons since he has 7 locations that are supposed to be shown on the map. Below is a image of **Lorenzo Wallaces** map, showing no events.

Going off of the journeys tab, the icons dedicated to a specific person take me on the life journey of the specific name that I was looking at. After clicking on the icon, I was able to see a 1, 2, 3 etc… and this shows the order of the events that took place, from beginning to end. However, there is nothing stopping the user from clicking on the number 10 event first, simply because the icon does not indicate a number until the user clicks on it. If the icons were in number order, it would make for a much easier user experience so that they do not read the events out of order. 

Overall, this project was extremely informative and interesting. Creating an easy to use database is a difficult task, yet the creators of this project do an excellent job at keeping it uncomplicated. There will always be areas of improvement on projects such as these, but if the positives outweigh the negatives, then I feel like the creators have done an adirmable job. However, in this project, the positives heavily outweigh the negatives, making this an excellent piece of work.
