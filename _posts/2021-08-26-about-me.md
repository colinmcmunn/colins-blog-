## My Story
I am Colin McMunn, and I am a clothing brand entrepreneur. I realized my love for business at the age of 6, when I sold ripped pieces of paper with marker scribbles on them at the bottom of my driveway. I sold them as “bookmarks” for $5 a piece, so I guess you could say I was destined to start my own business. As years went by, I began having these incredible thoughts, but would never put them to work. I had the mindset that I would put everything off until after college, and that all my dreams and aspirations would somehow work itself out. However one day in the summer of 2017, I decided to put myself to work.
  
  The summer of 2017 was life changing. I began putting all of my learning and focus into the business methods used by the ultra-successful. In that time, I watched youtube seminars, read books, and attended venture capital sit-ins, all to learn the ins and outs of what made a successful business run. 
 
 While I watched them, their most important lesson didn’t hit me right away, however, I vividly remember the moment that changed my life.  That day I was on Facetime with my best friend obviously talking about ways to get rich fast, since that’s the only thing we ever talked about.  He made me watch a video of a 17-year-old millionaire and app designer. As I listened to the video I thought “wow, this kid is making big things happen. What am I doing?” That was the moment I realized the most important lesson every speaker focused on; each of them said “stop thinking and go do it.” The rest of the day I spent thinking about every type of business possible. Later that same day,  my best friend texted out of the blue “Clothing Brand.” I knew instantly what he was thinking and fell in love with the idea immediately.
  
  The first thing we focused on was deciding what to name for our soon to be company. We assumed this would be the easiest part when starting a company, however we discovered that it wasn’t the case. After 2 months we still hadn’t settled on a name and we began to second guess our idea when all by accident we found the perfect name -- “_Culture Rising_”. It was perfect!  Well at least we thought it was for  the first month before we discovered it was an online retailer for marijuana. This became the first of many struggles. 
  
  Now it was as if we had to start all over. About a month after we had come up with our first name, we came up with [“Culture DC”](https://www.instagram.com/cltrdc/?hl=en). The name seemed to be a hit, growing our instagram page to over 5,000 followers, and selling out our first two merchandise releases in about a week each.

I have always lived by the saying, “**For every 20 failures, there is one success**”. Several times this business didn’t seem like it would take off, but I realized that the only thing stopping it was myself. If I wanted something, all I needed to do was go do it. Every entrepreneur knows that there will never be a perfect road when on the path to success, and while the successful ones continue to work their way up the mountain, those not willing to do so will end up in an entrepreneurial graveyard.
